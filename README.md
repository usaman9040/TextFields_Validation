Form Validation

## Prompt
Think about a digital form. A form is typically made up of fields. Each field has its own context or type (string, number, location, a set of options, etc). To submit the form, all of its fields need to be valid. In order for a field to be valid, it needs to conform to a set of rules that are applied to that field.

Your challenge solution should be able to support anything from a simple sign-up form with username and password fields to a complex intakeÂ form with multiple sections and dozens of fields of various types.
Your form needs to perform validation rules on data entered, for example:

- Required fields before submission
- Minimum/Maximum length
- Character set inclusion/exclusion input constraints
